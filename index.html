    EMAIL PRINTOUT
    --------------------------------------------------

    Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look who relaxedly sat down with a cup of coffee
    to read email!

    Are we at Asteroid Tycoon known for relaxedly reading email? No, that is
    not what we are known for. We are known for our efficiency, and more
    importantly, we are known in our productivity.

    Sometimes I tear up, thinking about our growth over the last eight quarters.
    We have grown by 50% or more each year. And this year we will deplete our
    10,000th asteroid.

    But you are not part of that equation. But of course you know that
    - if you had met standards in the first place you wouldn't be stuck where you
    are now. Your branch had the weakest performance of the last year; you let your
    colony staff nearly starve to death, and you blew company money on frivolous
    expenses. Hence your "lateral promotion."

    Our accountant said that firing you is inconvenient for tax purposes.

    But we can't trust you with large amounts of money or human lives
    any more. Heck, we don't even trust you with any decent robots for fear you'd
    mess them up too. So welcome to your new post, equipped with the finest robot
    that engineering could put together from scraps in the waste pile. They named
    it SquirrelBot.

    It can't mine and it can't dig through anything harder than dirt.

    Have fun with that.

    - Corporate

<script id='unlock-bearBot' type='text'>
    EMAIL PRINTOUT
    --------------------------------------------------

    Reading the reports you've been sending back about all the work you've
    accomplished with your SquirrelBots created such a sense of disgust for me
    that I decided I'd rather die than have to read such a pathetic report
    ever again.

    Out of sheer pity, I gave R&D fifteen minutes to Frankenstein together
    a new bot for you out more junk. BearBot: a mining robot that can quickly
    clear away dirt and can even pick up some minerals along the way.

    Might as well make your stay on this
    godforsaken rock useful.

    - Corporate

<script id='unlock-vultureBot' type='text'>
    EMAIL PRINTOUT
    --------------------------------------------------

    Oh boy, judging by the trail of dead robots you've left in your wake, you're
    really gonna need this one. The VultureBot sucks up the rubble strewn
    about this asteroid and lets you recoup some of your costly, costly losses.

    Brake 'em, scoop 'em back up, use the pieces to build more mediocre robots.
    Just the robot circle of life. Accounting loves it.

    - Corporate

<script id='unlock-antBot' type='text'>
    EMAIL PRINTOUT
    --------------------------------------------------

    Your performance so far, while far from being commendable, has at least
    demonstrated to us a basic competence in maneuvering heavy machinery.

    We have tentatively decided to increase your robotic workforce.

    While still made from refuse, the AntBot has significantly higher
    drill power than the BearBot, with capacity to match.

    Don't expect a bonus this year.

<script id='unlock-goatBot' type='text'>
    EMAIL PRINTOUT
    --------------------------------------------------

    While watching you struggle with the tougher was entertaining at first,
    it's gotten boring. Hurry up.

    Here's a GoatBot. It's as careful with resources as company files say you
    are. And by that I mean it blunders around smashing things, destroying
    valuable goods in the process.

    The GoatBot will smash through most obstacles you've encountered so far,
    but is unable to harvest any minerals, destroying them instead.
    Use the GoatBot with care.

    Repeat -- use the GoatBot with care. Company policy forbids the GoatBot
    from being used to waste minerals. If we catch you doing so, there will
    be consequences.

    --------------------------------------------------

    It looks like your old bots just aren't up to the task anymore, are they?
    We have heard your whining and are sending over two sets of blueprints: one for
    an upgraded SquirrelBot with more energy and longer vision and one for an
    upgraded BearBot with a stronger drill and higher efficiency.

    Yes, the upgrades aren't cheap, but we trust that you have been careful with
    Asteroid Tycoon's money.

    EMAIL PRINTOUT
    --------------------------------------------------

    You have now stumbled your way across three asteroids. While your performance
    has been far from what we would expect at a company as prestigious as Asteroid
    Tycoon, good deeds must still be rewarded one way or another.

    We are sending over blueprints for an upgraded AntBot, GoatBot, and VultureBot.
    Don't make us regret this.

    Well don't just stand here! Quickly, to Cashmonoid!

    You almost have all the pieces you need to put together the ultimate drilling
    machine. For perhaps the first time in your sorry life, there is a chance you
    may amount to something.

    --------------------------------------------------

    Good job! You found some harder rock under all that not-as-hard rock, with
    some other mineral beneath it.

    So when you're done messing around there get over to the next asteroid,
    Cheddaroid. You do realize that this isn't the only asteroid you're supposed
    to deal with, right? There are four more waiting for your attention. We do hope
    that we don't have to remind you about the Asteroid Field Map access button
    on the top-right corner of your control panel.

    You're already on thin ice with the company, I'm sure you don't want me
    including in my report that you wasted company time staring at minerals
    buried beneath rock we have no way of penetrating.

    Back to work!

    EMAIL PRINTOUT
    --------------------------------------------------

    I'm getting really sick of your memos whining at me for more information
    about the unreachable mineral.

    Let the professionals - you know, the ones not on probation - handle the
    business end. You can just go back to playing with your toys in the sand pit,
    or whatever you're calling that rock you're on.

    --------------------------------------------------

    The government shipment has arrived!

    This is what you - we - have been working towards this whole time! Surely you
    didn't really think we didn't care about all of that sweet sweet motherlodium
    at the core of the asteroids you've been mining.

    We couldn't crack the core to get to it earlier, but our government contact
    has made good on his word. The BadgerBot has arrived!

    Seriously, be careful. That thing was designed from the ground up to be the
    most terrifying sight any rock or mineral has ever seen. Do you see that
    saw blade? That's what you can achieve with a multi-billion space dollar
    defense budget.

    Now get out and there and get my - our - motherlodium!

    - Corporate
</script>
<script id='theEnd' type='text'>
    EMAIL PRINTOUT
    --------------------------------------------------

    Motherlodium! All of the motherlodium in the entire system! And how beautiful
    it is.

    When you return, we will discuss the terms of your promotion!


    - Corporate



    PS: And by that I mean promotion to "Captain of the Abandoned Asteroid Field."

    Accounting says that now that we have the motherlodium and a ten-year weapons 
    development contract with the government we can afford a simple funeral for a
    brave company employee who lost his life in a tragic space mining accident.

    Hint: that brave employee is you! Enjoy the last of your air supply.

<script id='nobotleftbehind' type='text'>

    --------------------------------------------------

    Bear in mind that jumping out into the Asteroid Field now will mean the
    destruction of all of our robots on this asteroid.

    This is exactly the kind of careless behavior and resource abuse that
    landed you out here in the first place.

    Do not look directly into the alien artifacts. We repeat - do not look directly
    into the alien artifacts. Just beam them all back to headquarters as quickly
    as possible along with all the other junk you find.

    Try not to touch them if you can help it, either.

    And don't ask questions!
