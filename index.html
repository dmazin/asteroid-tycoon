    EMAIL PRINTOUT
    --------------------------------------------------

    Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look who relaxedly sat down with a cup of coffee
    to read email!

    Are we at Asteroid Tycoon known for relaxedly reading email? No, that is
    not what we are known for. We are known for our efficiency, and more
    importantly, we are known in our productivity.

    Sometimes I tear up, thinking about our growth over the last eight quarters.
    We have grown by 50% or more each year. And this year we will deplete our
    10,000th asteroid.

    But you are not part of that equation. But of course you know that
    - if you had met standards in the first place you wouldn't be stuck where you
    are now. Your branch had the weakest performance of the last year; you let your
    colony staff nearly starve to death, and you blew company money on frivolous
    expenses. Hence your "lateral promotion."

    Our accountant said that firing you is inconvenient for tax purposes.

    But we can't trust you with large amounts of money or human lives
    any more. Heck, we don't even trust you with any decent robots for fear you'd
    mess them up too. So welcome to your new post, equipped with the finest robot
    that engineering could put together from scraps in the waste pile. They named
    it SquirrelBot.

    It can't mine and it can't dig through anything harder than dirt.

    Have fun with that.

    You're not going to get very far with scouts alone. R&D's cooked up the
    BearBot: a mining robot that can quickly clear away dirt and can even pick
    up some minerals along the way. Might as well make your stay on this
    godforsaken rock useful.

    --------------------------------------------------

    Oh boy, judging by the trail of dead robots you've left in your wake, you're
    really gonna need this one. The VultureBot sucks up the rubble strewn
    about this asteroid and lets you recoup some of your costly, costly losses.

    And you do realize that this isn't the only asteroid you're supposed to deal
    with, right? There are four more waiting for your attention. We do hope that
    we don't have to remind you about the Asteroid Field button on the top-right
    corner of this panel.

    --------------------------------------------------

    Your performance so far, while far from being commendable, has at least
    demonstrated to us a basic competence in maneuvering heavy machinery.

    The AntBot has significantly higher drill power than the BearBot, with
    capacity to match. Count is as a gift from us. Don't expect a bonus this year.

    EMAIL PRINTOUT
    --------------------------------------------------

    As per protocol, we are required to send you over a GoatBot at this time.
    It will smash through most obstacles you've encountered so far, but is unable
    to harvest any minerals, destroying them instead. Use the GoatBot with care.

    Repeat -- use the GoatBot with care. Company policy forbids the GoatBot
    from being used to waste minerals. If we catch you doing so, there will
    be consequences.

    Good job! You found some harder rock under all that not as hard rock, with
    some other mineral beneath it.

    When you're done messing around there get over to the next asteroid. You're
    already on thin ice with the company, I'm sure you don't want me including
    in my report that you wasted company time staring at minerals buried
    beneath rock we have no way of penetrating.

    Back to work!

    EMAIL PRINTOUT
    --------------------------------------------------

    I'm getting really sick of your memos whining at me for more information
    about the unreachable mineral.

    Let the professionals - you know, the ones not on probabtion - handle the
    business end. You can just go back to playing with your toys in the sand pit,
    or whatever you're calling that rock you're on.

    Bear in mind that jumping out into the asteroid field now will mean the
    destruction of all of our robots on this asteroid. Are you sure you want to
    do this?
